# Real-Times Glove Detection via Lightweight YOLOv3 with Enhanced Attention and Efficient IoU Loss
> Accurate and real-time glove detection is crucial for safeguarding worker safety in industrial environments. In this study, we present an enhanced glove detection network built upon a lightweight YOLOv3 architecture, incorporating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss function. These improvements resulted in significant gains, with a 3.4% increase in mAP50 and a 15.5% increase in mAP95, alongside a 30.9% acceleration in inference speed, a 54.65% reduction in parameters, and a 60.85% decrease in GFLOPS. Our method demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy in real-time glove detection, contributing significantly to enhancing worker safety in industrial settings. The proposed approach was evaluated on a self-built glove dataset, outperforming several state-of-the-art object detection models.
